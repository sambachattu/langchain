Till when can I view the paid videos on the website?
You can watch the videos till your subscription is valid, that is 3 years from the date of purchase for DSMP 2.0 and 2 years for DSMP 1.0

Why is lifetime validity not provided?
Because of the low course fee.

Do you assist with personal projects?
We do not provide support for personal projects or 1:1 mentorship due to time constraints and current commitments.


Where can I reach out in case of a doubt after a session?
You will have to fill a google form provided in your dashboard and our team will contact you for a 1 on 1 doubt clearing session.
